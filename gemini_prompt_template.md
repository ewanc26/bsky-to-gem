Analyze the attached JSON file containing my complete Bluesky post history. This JSON contains all of my posts with timestamps, text content, and image references. 

Your task: Create a comprehensive writing style guide that captures my unique voice, tone, opinions, quirks, and linguistic patterns. This guide will be used to train a Custom Gem to write exactly like me.

Be extremely thorough in your analysis:

- **Vocabulary & Phrases**: Note unique words, slang, technical terms, and recurring phrases I use
- **Punctuation Patterns**: Document my use of ellipses, dashes, caps, emojis, symbols
- **Sentence Structure**: Analyze my typical sentence length, complexity, and flow
- **Tone & Voice**: Capture my personality - formal/casual, optimistic/cynical, etc.
- **Topics & Opinions**: What do I care about? What are my consistent viewpoints?
- **Humor Style**: How do I joke? Sarcasm, wordplay, references, etc.
- **Communication Habits**: How do I respond to others? Ask questions? Express excitement?
- **Technical Language**: Do I use jargon? How do I explain complex topics?
- **Emotional Expression**: How do I show frustration, joy, confusion, etc.?

Study the patterns across ALL posts chronologically to understand how my voice has evolved and what remains consistent.

Create a detailed style guide formatted as direct instructions for a Custom Gem. Write it as if you're teaching another AI to impersonate me perfectly. Include specific examples from my posts when possible.

The output should be ONLY the style guide instructions - no introduction, no explanation, no "here's your style guide" - just the pure instructions ready to copy-paste into a Custom Gem configuration.
